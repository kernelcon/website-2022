    "talkDescription": "For many of us, hacking stemmed from a desire to have skills and access that others didn't have, to explore where we shouldn't belong, and to escape from social awkwardness. Punk and the genres that followed developed from the angst of youth and discontent with the status quo.\nAs a juvenile delinquent on the streets and behind the keyboard, I gravitated towards punk and hacking at an early age. To me, they are indelibly intertwined, with themes from both shaping my life's direction. Using my favorite songs as a backdrop, I'll share my perspective on the importance of being a hacker as technology and the world continue to evolve.",

This led us down a rabbit hole exploring the security of cryptocurrency exchanges, KYC platforms, monetary providers, brokerages, NFT platforms, smart contracts, and the hundred other services all built to support the nearly 2 trillion dollars tied up in cryptocurrency. We began hacking on the bug bounty programs for these services and, after working with a large number of entities, discovered that there were traditional vulnerabilities, novel techniques, and lots of room for interesting research against this newer environment. This talk explores the nearly 3 years of stories hacking cryptocurrency websites and our outlook for the future of cryptocurrency security from the perspective of traditional security consultants and bug bounty hunters.",

    "talkDescription": "This presentation demonstrates the use of the open-source Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) technology stack as a data analysis platform for raw Aircraft Communications and Reporting System (ACARS) data captured via software-defined-radio (SDR). The ELK Stack is intended as a log analysis tool capable of ingesting structured data from unknown sources and deriving fields from the structured data for system monitoring, system health, visualizations, and other functions. ELK is routinely used to ingest, index, and display (and natively recognizes) data from common IT utilities such as web servers, security audit logs, etc. For example, security operations teams regularly use the ELK stack to centralize monitoring and perform hunt operations on networks they defend. Here, we demonstrate how to leverage the ELK stack\u2019s capabilities to ingest data that has nothing to do with common IT utilities \u2013 in particular, raw aircraft communications data captured via SDR. Using a system of relatively low-cost components, open-source software, and cloud computing, we will demonstrate how we captured raw ACARS data across multiple locations, structured it for transport, and pushed it through an ingestion pipeline for analysis and display on our own AWS-hosted infrastructure for the purpose of trend analysis, reverse engineering, and keyword search.",

    "talkDescription": "The tool fpipe was simple 10kB windows console application written by Robin Keir that could redirect network traffic from one port from one computer to another. You can find it's usage in many early hacker books. As a hacker, I find fpipe's beauty is truly in its simplicity, with fpipe you don't have to download a 5mB golang binary, you don't have to bring along a cygwin library for socat, you don't have to rely upon programming languages being on the host, there's no configuration, you just download this very small executable and run it from a command line. The fpipe program has been around since the early 2000's and it's source code never saw the light of day. Thanks to modern decompilers like ghidra the task of reverse engineering how it works has become a more manageable task. With pseudocode in hand I hired a team of developers around the world to rebuild what was lost. In this talk you will learn about cost, detailed interactions, and lessons learned. You will leave the talk with a better understanding of the freelance developer community and perhaps even the source code to fpipe.",

I will explain what SCADA systems are used for in an OT network. And how and how they can control physical devices such as actuators, air handling equipment, and robotics. I will also discuss why an OT network is more vulnerable than a typical IT network, and how to implement an OT network into a corporate network safely. I will discuss how to properly segment an OT network, so it is safe from an existing IT network, different network architectures for combined OT/IT networks, secure network protocols for OT networks, tools to exploit OT, and how to train employees and improve upon governance of OT networks.

    "talkDescription": "In April 2016, Microsoft shocked the PC world when it announced the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL is a supplemental feature that runs a Linux image in a near-native environment on Windows, allowing for terminal functionality without the over-head of a virtual machine. While this new functionality was welcomed by developers, it also introduced a new attack surface threat actors can ( and do ) target. Black Lotus Labs recently identified several malicious files that were compiled in the Linux binary format ELF which utilized native windows APIs. Over the past several months, Black Lotus Labs has identified numerous \"stagers\" - i.e. lightweight scripts that load more robust agents into memory - keyloggers, and in some cases fully functional remote access trojans. The novelty of using an ELF loader designed for the WSL environment gave the technique a detection rate nearly, or in some cases a, zero for sample found on Virustotal. Suggesting that while this technique may be niche, as it requires WSL to be pre-installed by an admin, it can provide threat actors a blind spot to operate while evading some EDR products. This talk will briefly introduce WSL, then focus on the samples Black Lotus Labs observed abusing this feature in the wild, and how we analyzed these malicious files.",

    "talkDescription": "Mergers, buy-outs, divestitures: These are just a few of the ways in which companies can transform literally overnight. Today acquisitions are on the rise, as leaders are looking for growth after the pandemic slowdown, and as new business models emerge based on the shift in consumer demands and mindset. This restructuring of organizations while buying or merging with another company can be cost-effective as they can reduce the costs of developing business activities that will complement a company's strengths. It can be a good investment to achieve its strategic long term goals for an organization while increasing the supply-chain pricing power and also eliminating the possible business competitors. While these moves often help a company remain competitive, if it is not done right it can make or break an organization.Weakened cybersecurity hygiene throughout the last year means that these M&A transactions elevate the risk of cybersecurity incidents. M&A can be a breeding battle ground for cyberattacks and data breaches. With the passage of the GDPR and the CCPA, and with more data privacy laws in the works, cybersecurity, and data privacy have become crucial elements of pre-M&A due diligence. Thorough due diligence that includes a focus on cybersecurity will help reduce regrets later in the deal lifecycle. Today's M&A plans need to include cybersecurity at several strategic and tactical points, to address growing scrutiny from regulators and other evolving cybersecurity risks. This track covers lessons from the recent M&A transactions that never got off the ground or whose deal value was severely undermined by data security issues and ways acquiring organizations can avoid these failures by thoroughly analyzing the security flaws of the company to be able to negotiate or walk away from the deal instead of regretting later.",

These new technologies introduce new attack vectors, and must be defended in unique ways. You're not \"just running on someone else's servers\" when workloads come and go in seconds.  How do you secure a function when the communication layer is opaque to you?  Can you govern container use well enough to protect it, but without slowing down developers and the business?  Heck, do you even know what's out there? This session will provide you with enough knowledge to begin securing the your most important assets in the cloud.  Sure, cloud-native workloads can seem mysterious, but once you know the differences (and hidden pitfalls) of cloud-native workloads, you'll be in good shape to start defending them.",

    "talkDescription": "As digital transformation accelerates, software developers face increasing pressure to speed up their work, and open-source software helps them meet aggressive timelines by dropping standardized code into an application. But cyber criminals are targeting more attacks on the software supply chain, exploiting software vulnerabilities that occur in production. As a result, organizations must prioritize protecting the open-source code in their applications. Attend this session to learn about the findings from the telemetry of thousands of real-world applications revealing trends of library usage, vulnerabilities, and best practices. You will learn about surprising findings such as: * Less than 10% of code in the typical application is open-source code actually used by the software. * Legacy software composition analysis (SCA) tools have a false positive rate of up to 69%. * The average library uses a version that is 2.5 years old, increasing risk and promising future headaches. * High-risk licenses are present in 69% of Java applications and 33% of Node applications. In a world of accelerating development and frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities, protecting applications containing open-source libraries and frameworks requires a different approach. Organizations need a comprehensive picture of active and inactive libraries and classes, library age, vulnerabilities, and licensing issues. Such observability enables an organization to address the riskiest issues - and not waste time with vulnerabilities that pose no risk.",
