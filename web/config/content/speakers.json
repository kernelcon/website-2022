      "abstract": "This presentation demonstrates the use of the open-source Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) technology stack as a data analysis platform for raw Aircraft Communications and Reporting System (ACARS) data captured via software-defined-radio (SDR). The ELK Stack is intended as a log analysis tool capable of ingesting structured data from unknown sources and deriving fields from the structured data for system monitoring, system health, visualizations, and other functions. ELK is routinely used to ingest, index, and display (and natively recognizes) data from common IT utilities such as web servers, security audit logs, etc. For example, security operations teams regularly use the ELK stack to centralize monitoring and perform hunt operations on networks they defend. Here, we demonstrate how to leverage the ELK stack\u2019s capabilities to ingest data that has nothing to do with common IT utilities \u2013 in particular, raw aircraft communications data captured via SDR. Using a system of relatively low-cost components, open-source software, and cloud computing, we will demonstrate how we captured raw ACARS data across multiple locations, structured it for transport, and pushed it through an ingestion pipeline for analysis and display on our own AWS-hosted infrastructure for the purpose of trend analysis, reverse engineering, and keyword search."

Today acquisitions are on the rise, as leaders are looking for growth after the pandemic slowdown, and as new business models emerge based on the shift in consumer demands and mindset. This restructuring of organizations while buying or merging with another company can be cost-effective as they can reduce the costs of developing business activities that will complement a company\u2019s strengths. It can be a good investment to achieve its strategic long term goals for an organization while increasing the supply-chain pricing power and also eliminating the possible business competitors. While these moves often help a company remain competitive, if it is not done right it can make or break an organization.Weakened cybersecurity hygiene throughout the last year means that these M&A transactions elevate the risk of cybersecurity incidents. M&A can be a breeding battle ground for cyberattacks and data breaches. With the passage of the GDPR and the CCPA, and with more data privacy laws in the works, cybersecurity, and data privacy have become crucial elements of pre-M&A due diligence. Thorough due diligence that includes a focus on cybersecurity will help reduce regrets later in the deal lifecycle.\u201d Today\u2019s M&A plans need to include cybersecurity at several strategic and tactical points, to address growing scrutiny from regulators and other evolving cybersecurity risks.This track covers lessons from the recent M&A transactions that never got off the ground or whose deal value was severely undermined by data security issues and ways acquiring organizations can avoid these failures by thoroughly analyzing the security flaws of the company to be able to negotiate or walk away from the deal instead of regretting later."

These new technologies introduce new attack vectors, and must be defended in unique ways.\r\n\r\n\tYou're not \"just running on someone else's servers\" when workloads come and go in seconds.  How do you secure a function when the communication layer is opaque to you?  Can you govern container use well enough to protect it, but without slowing down developers and the business?  Heck, do you even know what's out there?\r\n\r\n\tThis session will provide you with enough knowledge to begin securing the your most important assets in the cloud.  Sure, cloud-native workloads can seem mysterious, but once you know the differences (and hidden pitfalls) of cloud-native workloads, you'll be in good shape to start defending them."

WSL is a supplemental feature that runs a Linux image in a near-native environment on Windows, allowing for terminal functionality without the over-head of a virtual machine. While this new functionality was welcomed by developers, it also introduced a new attack surface threat actors can \u2013 and do \u2013 target. Black Lotus Labs recently identified several malicious files that were compiled in the Linux binary format ELF which utilized native windows APIs. Over the past several months, Black Lotus Labs has identified numerous \u201cstagers\u201d - i.e. lightweight scripts that load more robust agents into memory - keyloggers, and in some cases fully functional remote access trojans. The novelty of using an ELF loader designed for the WSL environment gave the technique a detection rate nearly, or in some cases a, zero for sample found on Virustotal. Suggesting that while this technique may be niche, as it requires WSL to be pre-installed by an admin, it can provide threat actors a blind spot to operate while evading some EDR products.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis talk will briefly introduce WSL, then focus on the samples Black Lotus Labs observed abusing this feature in the wild, and how we analyzed these malicious files."

At the crossroads of new technologies and vast sums of capital there exists a ripe target for scams and phishing, despite all the lessons the infosec community has learned. This talk opens with a brief coverage of generic blockchain concepts and NFTs before exploring how scammers have leveraged this new space to part users from their hard earned cash.

Additionally, attackers need to find one small pinhole into an environment, but as Security professionals we need to find and defend every pinhole / chunk / massive crater that exists in the dam of our processes / technology / people. How do we overcome these challenges and how do we \u201cwin\u201d the Security war or even compete in the skirmishes that are fought every day?
