Us either.</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Last year Kernelcon had 12 unique stickers that our most creative individuals (and sometimes their family members) spent hours designing. Attendees received a handful of the same unique stickers so they could trade with others and collect the whole set.  It was one of our most talked about swag items, and a fun way to meet new people and get your sticker on.</p>\n            <p className='tab-heading'>This year, we would like our community to be a part of the sticker process!</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>So, even if you don't have a creative bone in your body, we would love to see your design! If your design is just an idea, we will try to help fledgling artists achieve their <span className='text-highlight'>vision</span>. Do you have an innovative artist in your family? We accept designs from attendee's family members too! It would be wonderful to include as many people as we can!</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Are you still interested?  If so, please send your sticker design to <a href='mailto:stickers@kernelcon.org' className='text-highlight' rel='noopener noreferrer'>stickers@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will pick twelve awesome designs for this year's stickers and you will each get a shoutout and a paragraph in the conference book to describe your design.</p>\n            <p className='fine-notes'>Note: Please keep your design to a high resolution (> 300dpi) file.
