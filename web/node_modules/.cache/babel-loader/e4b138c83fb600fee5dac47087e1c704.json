Many beers were had and slides discussed before culminating in a mission to gather knowledge seekers in the Midwest to propagate their techniques and mastery. Enter Kernelcon.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"tab-paragraph\">In 2019, we exceeded our targets with two speaking tracks, several conference events, and competitions for more than 350 attendees.  In 2020 we were one of the first security conferences to pivot to a pure-virtual format, populating two speaker live-streams, offering pre-conference training, and innovative virtual activities for our more than 400 paid attendees.  With the time to consider and plan for 2021 in a virtual context, we pioneered HackLive!, an online event that saw experts in various hacking disciplines hack challenges in their domain live.  Kernelcon partnered with the Ultimate Hacking Championship and brought HackLive! to thousands of world-wide viewers.</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">For 2022, we are excited to return as an in-person event!  We are starting the festivities with two full days of training.  In the days immediately following training, we welcome both seasoned professionals and novice beginners to network, share their wisdom, and learn from one another during two days of affordable Cornhusker camaraderie. Laughs will be had and popcorn eaten at this intimate and enriching event. Our organizers are driven to provide both a new generation with the experiences that inspired us to love Infosec and bolster our community with a strong network of professionals. We are made stronger together.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"tab-title\">Suggested topic areas</div>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">The theme for Kernelcon 2022, is “Punk.”  Accordingly, those that wish to tailor a talk to the theme or require a broad topic to start the creative engine toward a new talk, Punk is your starting point.  Consider Punk Rock, Pop Punk, Cipherpunk, Cyberpunk, SteamPunk….but do not let these directions limit your interpretation!</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Kernelcon submissions should focus on topics that are of interest to the security and hacking communities. The list below is meant as a guideline, not an exhaustive list.</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">\n          <ul className=\"real-bullet-list\">\n            <li>Hacking of Software/Hardware</li>\n            <li>Incident Response</li>\n            <li>Operational Security</li>\n            <li>Computing Hardware Security, Repurposing, Designing/Building</li>\n            <li>Technology Policy and Politics (yep, we're willing to go there)</li>\n            <li>Security Education</li>\n            <li>Security and Hacking Capture-the-Flag Topics</li>\n            <li>Security Automation</li>\n            <li>Digital Forensics</li>\n            <li>Bug Bounties</li>\n            <li>Secure Development Practices / DevSecOps / SecDevOps</li>\n            <li>Security Aspects of Cloud Computing</li>\n            <li>Practical Security</li>\n            <li>Machine Learning (securing, and using for security)</li>\n            <li>War Stories, Histories, Scientific Advancement, Trade, etc. of Kernels</li>\n            <li>Security Metrics (Inform Risk Analysis, Identify Priorities, Measure Progress, etc)</li>\n            <li>Risk Management</li>\n            <li>BeyondCorp / Zerotrust models in practice</li>\n            <li>Privacy and Anonymity</li>\n            <li>Identity & Access Management</li>\n            <li>Focused Security Research (Visualization, IoT, Vehicles, Toys, Web apps, etc)</li>\n          </ul>\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">If your talk doesn't fit precisely into one of these areas, the theme, but you still think is a good fit, please submit it for consideration! The suggested topics are meant only to provide some direction, not as a strict pedantic gate through which all submissions must pass.</p>\n\n          <div className=\"tab-title\">Conference format</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Kernelcon 2022 will have two, concurrent main tracks, and talks should fit into a 60 (FULL) or 20 (SHORT) minute timeslot (meaning a 50 or 15 minute presentation is expected). As one might expect, presenters will be positioned at the front of a hotel conference area, and will present using typical conference equipment.</p>\n\n          <div className=\"tab-title\">Speaker Benefits</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Speakers receive complimentary admission to Kernelcon and will be recognized as a speaker via a special “SPEAKER” badge. Speakers also have the option of attending an exclusive speaker party preceding the conference. Details will be sent to accepted speakers following acceptance notification.</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">For each FULL talk, the speakers may additionally select one of:</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">\n            <ul className=\"real-bullet-list\">\n              <li>2 additional “HACKER” registrations</li>\n              <li>$200 donation to the EFF or Hackers for Charity</li>\n              <li>$200 honorarium</li>\n              <li>Please reinvest into making Kernelcon even better next year</li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">We may also tentatively accept backup/alternate talks which will not be guaranteed a speaking slot, but will receive admission in order to be ready to present in the event they are needed.</p>\n\n          <div className=\"tab-title\">Review process</div>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Our review process is not as formal as some academic conferences. However, submissions are considered confidential and are not shared outside of the Technical Program Committee. Every submission is reviewed by multiple committee members and weighed for inclusion in the program. TPC Committee members are selected for the ability to provide valuable reviews, handle sensitive information, and remain fair, impartial, and consistent in the review process. Ultimately the committee informs the TPC Chair(s) who set the technical portion of the program that is married with the rest of Kernelcon agenda.</p>\n\n          <div className=\"tab-title\">How to submit</div>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Speakers should submit directly (e.g. no PR representatives are permitted).</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Please print the pdf for your convenience!</p>\n          <p className=\"tab-paragraph\">Your submission email should include:\n            <ul className=\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\">\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Speaker name(s)</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Contact information (email, twitter, phone, etc - if we need to reach you and we can't, that's on you) *</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Speaker promotion information (twitter, facebook, etc) - if we want to promote your talk specifically, and you want us to tag you</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Presentation Title *</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Abstract *</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>A note if you'd like your submission to be presented to the program committee anonymously for review</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>The speaker \"Grant of Copyright Use\" and \"Speaker Terms\" copied and completed from below</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Optional supplementary files</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Optional scheduling preferences</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Optional opt-out of video recording</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Headshot if you have one you'd like to share (to be honest, we aren't sure if we'll use these, but if we need one, and you don't provide it, you will be depicted as a kernel of grain, nut, fruit, or corn)</li>\n              <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>At least one attached file in TEXT or PDF format which contains the following information in this order:\n                <ul className=\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\">\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Title of Presentation **</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Speaker Name(s), Pseudonym(s), or handle(s) **</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Timeslot (20 or 60 minutes)</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Abstract of your presentation (200 words or less) **</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Bio limited to 100 words or less (less than 100 words encompassing all speakers) **</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Technical Level of talk: on a 1-none to 5-all the way down the rabbit hole **</li>\n                  <li><input className=\"fake-checkbox\" type=\"checkbox\"/>Detailed Description: <b className=\"text-highlight\">the most important part</b> of your submission.
