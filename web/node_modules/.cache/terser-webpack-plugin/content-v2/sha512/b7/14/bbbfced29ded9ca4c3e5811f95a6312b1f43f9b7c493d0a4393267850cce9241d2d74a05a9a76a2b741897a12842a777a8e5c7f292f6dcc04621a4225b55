The ELK Stack is intended as a log analysis tool capable of ingesting structured data from unknown sources and deriving fields from the structured data for system monitoring, system health, visualizations, and other functions. ELK is routinely used to ingest, index, and display (and natively recognizes) data from common IT utilities such as web servers, security audit logs, etc. For example, security operations teams regularly use the ELK stack to centralize monitoring and perform hunt operations on networks they defend. Here, we demonstrate how to leverage the ELK stack’s capabilities to ingest data that has nothing to do with common IT utilities – in particular, raw aircraft communications data captured via SDR. Using a system of relatively low-cost components, open-source software, and cloud computing, we will demonstrate how we captured raw ACARS data across multiple locations, structured it for transport, and pushed it through an ingestion pipeline for analysis and display on our own AWS-hosted infrastructure for the purpose of trend analysis, reverse engineering, and keyword search.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkTechLevel\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"acars\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"postCon\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"pdfLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"videoLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"authors\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Carl Schuett\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"speakerId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"CarlSchuett\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"company\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"twitter\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"github\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"linkedIn\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https:/www.linkedin.com/in/carl-schuett-1a5a0b80/\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"bio\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Jesse and Carl are Security Researchers for QED Secure Solutions.

The fpipe program has been around since the early 2000's and it's source code never saw the light of day. Thanks to modern decompilers like ghidra the task of reverse engineering how it works has become a more manageable task.

But cyber criminals are targeting more attacks on the software supply chain, exploiting software vulnerabilities that occur in production. As a result, organizations must prioritize protecting the open-source code in their applications. Attend this session to learn about the findings from the telemetry of thousands of real-world applications revealing trends of library usage, vulnerabilities, and best practices. You will learn about surprising findings such as: * Less than 10% of code in the typical application is open-source code actually used by the software. * Legacy software composition analysis (SCA) tools have a false positive rate of up to 69%. * The average library uses a version that is 2.5 years old, increasing risk and promising future headaches. * High-risk licenses are present in 69% of Java applications and 33% of Node applications. In a world of accelerating development and frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities, protecting applications containing open-source libraries and frameworks requires a different approach. Organizations need a comprehensive picture of active and inactive libraries and classes, library age, vulnerabilities, and licensing issues. Such observability enables an organization to address the riskiest issues - and not waste time with vulnerabilities that pose no risk.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkTechLevel\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"risksmatter\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"postCon\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"pdfLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"videoLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"authors\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"David Lindner\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"speakerId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"DavidLindner\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"company\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Contrast Security\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"twitter\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"@golfhackerdave\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"github\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"linkedIn\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https:/www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"DavidLindner.jpg\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"bio\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"David is an experienced application security professional with over 20 years in cybersecurity.

WSL is a supplemental feature that runs a Linux image in a near-native environment on Windows, allowing for terminal functionality without the over-head of a virtual machine. While this new functionality was welcomed by developers, it also introduced a new attack surface threat actors can ( and do ) target. Black Lotus Labs recently identified several malicious files that were compiled in the Linux binary format ELF which utilized native windows APIs. Over the past several months, Black Lotus Labs has identified numerous \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stagers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - i.e. lightweight scripts that load more robust agents into memory - keyloggers, and in some cases fully functional remote access trojans. The novelty of using an ELF loader designed for the WSL environment gave the technique a detection rate nearly, or in some cases a, zero for sample found on Virustotal. Suggesting that while this technique may be niche, as it requires WSL to be pre-installed by an admin, it can provide threat actors a blind spot to operate while evading some EDR products. This talk will briefly introduce WSL, then focus on the samples Black Lotus Labs observed abusing this feature in the wild, and how we analyzed these malicious files.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkTechLevel\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"abusingwsl\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"postCon\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"pdfLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"videoLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"authors\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Daniel Adamitis\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"speakerId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"DanielAdamitis\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"company\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"twitter\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"@dadamiti\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"github\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"linkedIn\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"https:/www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-a-44198047/\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Adamitis_headshot.jpg\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"bio\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Daniel Adamitis is a Principal Information Security Engineer at Lumen Technologies responsible for advanced actor tracking and threat intelligence.

Today acquisitions are on the rise, as leaders are looking for growth after the pandemic slowdown, and as new business models emerge based on the shift in consumer demands and mindset. This restructuring of organizations while buying or merging with another company can be cost-effective as they can reduce the costs of developing business activities that will complement a company's strengths. It can be a good investment to achieve its strategic long term goals for an organization while increasing the supply-chain pricing power and also eliminating the possible business competitors. While these moves often help a company remain competitive, if it is not done right it can make or break an organization.Weakened cybersecurity hygiene throughout the last year means that these M&A transactions elevate the risk of cybersecurity incidents. M&A can be a breeding battle ground for cyberattacks and data breaches. With the passage of the GDPR and the CCPA, and with more data privacy laws in the works, cybersecurity, and data privacy have become crucial elements of pre-M&A due diligence. Thorough due diligence that includes a focus on cybersecurity will help reduce regrets later in the deal lifecycle. Today's M&A plans need to include cybersecurity at several strategic and tactical points, to address growing scrutiny from regulators and other evolving cybersecurity risks. This track covers lessons from the recent M&A transactions that never got off the ground or whose deal value was severely undermined by data security issues and ways acquiring organizations can avoid these failures by thoroughly analyzing the security flaws of the company to be able to negotiate or walk away from the deal instead of regretting later.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkTechLevel\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"3\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"talkId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"mastering-m-and-a\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"postCon\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"pdfLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"videoLink\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"authors\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Reet Kaur\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"speakerId\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"ReetKaur\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"company\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"twitter\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"github\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"linkedIn\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"bio\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Reet Kaur is a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at the largest higher-ed institute in Portland, Oregon, where she leads a team responsible for all aspects of College`s Information Security Program to enable the business in providing education to more than 85,000 students at several locations in the Portland Metro Area.

Although you may be familiar with a specific offensive or defensive use case for OSINT, you may not consider the opposite use case. Additionally, there is an entire world of investigations outside of Information Security, of which many are not aware. This course leverages both offensive and defensive applications of OSINT, in addition to pure investigative techniques, to equip students with an analytic toolkit for investigating businesses. The goal is to apply the “red yarn” to connect the proverbial red dots of seemingly unrelated and disparate abstract data in any OSINT investigation.</p><p>This course will start you at ground zero and equip you with an understanding of the bigger picture of intelligence operations. This is to get you into the mindset of an investigator to be more meticulous and patient in your collection and analysis. From here, we will springboard into applied search engines for OSINT to help you find the data you seek to find, which is often the case of not in what you “ask” the search engine, but how you ask it.</p><p>After search engines, you will be immersed in Open Source Image Intelligence (IMINT) and you work through learning about the types of image metadata, reverse image searching, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). You will conclude this module with a discussion of online video extraction for analysis in terms of tools and techniques to extract the video in addition to how you may find value in analyzing the video.</p><p>On day 2, you will learn about investigating businesses through their DNS records, social media, and public filings. You may already be familiar with some of the concepts in this module, but this module will help you develop analytic processes to more efficiently connect the proverbial dots. You will complete the day and the course with a capstone CTF event.</p>\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"short_form\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<p>This course will leverage the disciplines of OSINT, SOCMINT, IMINT, and Search Engine Intelligence, sometimes also known as Online Open Source Investigations (OOSI), Open Source Investigations (OSI), Publicly Accessible Information (PAI), Digital Investigations, or Social Media investigations in a manner that equips students with realistic techniques and scenarios to investigate businesses. This course could be applied to Red Team operators or penetration testers as well as Cyber Threat Intelligence, DFIR, or all-source Intelligence analysts. If you’re looking for a course on how to use several OSINT tools, this is not the course. This course will introduce you to sites and some tools but places more emphasis on the analysis methods and techniques – arming you with the ability to continue to operate independently of any tools or sites, so no worries if your favorite tool goes away or moves to a prohibitively expensive paid-only usage model. This course will satisfy 3 of the 6 courses required to attain a Black Badge from The OSINTion (https:/www.theosintion.com/courses/black-badge/).</p>\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"prerequisites\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<p>Some exposure to OSINT, IMINT, or Intelligence in general is helpful but not required.

The entire class can be performed using only a browser, although the instructor will do command line demonstrations using the Trace Labs Kali flavor of Linux.

This led us down a rabbit hole exploring the security of cryptocurrency exchanges, KYC platforms, monetary providers, brokerages, NFT platforms, smart contracts, and the hundred other services all built to support the nearly 35 trillion dollars tied up in cryptocurrency. We began hacking on the bug bounty programs for these services and, after working with a large number of entities, discovered that there were traditional vulnerabilities, novel techniques, and lots of room for interesting research against this newer environment.

The ELK Stack is intended as a log analysis tool capable of ingesting structured data from unknown sources and deriving fields from the structured data for system monitoring, system health, visualizations, and other functions. ELK is routinely used to ingest, index, and display (and natively recognizes) data from common IT utilities such as web servers, security audit logs, etc. For example, security operations teams regularly use the ELK stack to centralize monitoring and perform hunt operations on networks they defend. Here, we demonstrate how to leverage the ELK stack’s capabilities to ingest data that has nothing to do with common IT utilities – in particular, raw aircraft communications data captured via SDR. Using a system of relatively low-cost components, open-source software, and cloud computing, we will demonstrate how we captured raw ACARS data across multiple locations, structured it for transport, and pushed it through an ingestion pipeline for analysis and display on our own AWS-hosted infrastructure for the purpose of trend analysis, reverse engineering, and keyword search.\\\",\\\"talkTechLevel\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"talkId\\\":\\\"acars\\\",\\\"postCon\\\":{\\\"pdfLink\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"videoLink\\\":\\\"\\\"},\\\"authors\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Carl Schuett\\\",\\\"speakerId\\\":\\\"CarlSchuett\\\",\\\"company\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"twitter\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"github\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"linkedIn\\\":\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-schuett-1a5a0b80/\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"bio\\\":\\\"Jesse and Carl are Security Researchers for QED Secure Solutions.

You can find it's usage in many early hacker books. As a hacker, I find fpipe's beauty is truly in its simplicity, with fpipe you don't have to download a 5mB golang binary, you don't have to bring along a cygwin library for socat, you don't have to rely upon programming languages being on the host, there's no configuration, you just download this very small executable and run it from a command line. The fpipe program has been around since the early 2000's and it's source code never saw the light of day. Thanks to modern decompilers like ghidra the task of reverse engineering how it works has become a more manageable task. With pseudocode in hand I hired a team of developers around the world to rebuild what was lost. In this talk you will learn about cost, detailed interactions, and lessons learned. You will leave the talk with a better understanding of the freelance developer community and perhaps even the source code to fpipe.\\\",\\\"talkTechLevel\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"talkId\\\":\\\"fpipe\\\",\\\"postCon\\\":{\\\"pdfLink\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"videoLink\\\":\\\"\\\"},\\\"authors\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Mike Kunz\\\",\\\"speakerId\\\":\\\"MikeKunz\\\",\\\"company\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"twitter\\\":\\\"@mkunzsec\\\",\\\"github\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"linkedIn\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"bio\\\":\\\"Mike is a past winner of the Kernelcon CTF and holds a Eternal Kernel badge.

But cyber criminals are targeting more attacks on the software supply chain, exploiting software vulnerabilities that occur in production. As a result, organizations must prioritize protecting the open-source code in their applications. Attend this session to learn about the findings from the telemetry of thousands of real-world applications revealing trends of library usage, vulnerabilities, and best practices. You will learn about surprising findings such as: * Less than 10% of code in the typical application is open-source code actually used by the software. * Legacy software composition analysis (SCA) tools have a false positive rate of up to 69%. * The average library uses a version that is 2.5 years old, increasing risk and promising future headaches. * High-risk licenses are present in 69% of Java applications and 33% of Node applications. In a world of accelerating development and frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities, protecting applications containing open-source libraries and frameworks requires a different approach. Organizations need a comprehensive picture of active and inactive libraries and classes, library age, vulnerabilities, and licensing issues. Such observability enables an organization to address the riskiest issues - and not waste time with vulnerabilities that pose no risk.\\\",\\\"talkTechLevel\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"talkId\\\":\\\"risksmatter\\\",\\\"postCon\\\":{\\\"pdfLink\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"videoLink\\\":\\\"\\\"},\\\"authors\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"David Lindner\\\",\\\"speakerId\\\":\\\"DavidLindner\\\",\\\"company\\\":\\\"Contrast Security\\\",\\\"twitter\\\":\\\"@golfhackerdave\\\",\\\"github\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"linkedIn\\\":\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlindner\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"DavidLindner.jpg\\\",\\\"bio\\\":\\\"David is an experienced application security professional with over 20 years in cybersecurity.

WSL is a supplemental feature that runs a Linux image in a near-native environment on Windows, allowing for terminal functionality without the over-head of a virtual machine. While this new functionality was welcomed by developers, it also introduced a new attack surface threat actors can ( and do ) target. Black Lotus Labs recently identified several malicious files that were compiled in the Linux binary format ELF which utilized native windows APIs. Over the past several months, Black Lotus Labs has identified numerous \\\\\\\"stagers\\\\\\\" - i.e. lightweight scripts that load more robust agents into memory - keyloggers, and in some cases fully functional remote access trojans. The novelty of using an ELF loader designed for the WSL environment gave the technique a detection rate nearly, or in some cases a, zero for sample found on Virustotal. Suggesting that while this technique may be niche, as it requires WSL to be pre-installed by an admin, it can provide threat actors a blind spot to operate while evading some EDR products. This talk will briefly introduce WSL, then focus on the samples Black Lotus Labs observed abusing this feature in the wild, and how we analyzed these malicious files.\\\",\\\"talkTechLevel\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"talkId\\\":\\\"abusingwsl\\\",\\\"postCon\\\":{\\\"pdfLink\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"videoLink\\\":\\\"\\\"},\\\"authors\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Daniel Adamitis\\\",\\\"speakerId\\\":\\\"DanielAdamitis\\\",\\\"company\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"twitter\\\":\\\"@dadamiti\\\",\\\"github\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"linkedIn\\\":\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-a-44198047/\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"Adamitis_headshot.jpg\\\",\\\"bio\\\":\\\"Daniel Adamitis is a Principal Information Security Engineer at Lumen Technologies responsible for advanced actor tracking and threat intelligence.

Today acquisitions are on the rise, as leaders are looking for growth after the pandemic slowdown, and as new business models emerge based on the shift in consumer demands and mindset. This restructuring of organizations while buying or merging with another company can be cost-effective as they can reduce the costs of developing business activities that will complement a company's strengths. It can be a good investment to achieve its strategic long term goals for an organization while increasing the supply-chain pricing power and also eliminating the possible business competitors. While these moves often help a company remain competitive, if it is not done right it can make or break an organization.Weakened cybersecurity hygiene throughout the last year means that these M&A transactions elevate the risk of cybersecurity incidents. M&A can be a breeding battle ground for cyberattacks and data breaches. With the passage of the GDPR and the CCPA, and with more data privacy laws in the works, cybersecurity, and data privacy have become crucial elements of pre-M&A due diligence. Thorough due diligence that includes a focus on cybersecurity will help reduce regrets later in the deal lifecycle. Today's M&A plans need to include cybersecurity at several strategic and tactical points, to address growing scrutiny from regulators and other evolving cybersecurity risks. This track covers lessons from the recent M&A transactions that never got off the ground or whose deal value was severely undermined by data security issues and ways acquiring organizations can avoid these failures by thoroughly analyzing the security flaws of the company to be able to negotiate or walk away from the deal instead of regretting later.\\\",\\\"talkTechLevel\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"talkId\\\":\\\"mastering-m-and-a\\\",\\\"postCon\\\":{\\\"pdfLink\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"videoLink\\\":\\\"\\\"},\\\"authors\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Reet Kaur\\\",\\\"speakerId\\\":\\\"ReetKaur\\\",\\\"company\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"twitter\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"github\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"linkedIn\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"bio\\\":\\\"Reet Kaur is a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at the largest higher-ed institute in Portland, Oregon, where she leads a team responsible for all aspects of College`s Information Security Program to enable the business in providing education to more than 85,000 students at several locations in the Portland Metro Area.

Kernelcon is not just for hackers and IT professionals, it is for anyone who has an interest in computer security, hacking, malware research, or electronics.  If those or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy Kernelcon.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we’re sure people are listening.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Is there an age limit for attending Kernelcon?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No, while there is not content scheduled that is specifically focused on younger hackers, children are allowed. If they are under 14 years old, they receive free admission with a paid adult purchase.  All minors must be accompanied by a parent.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"What is the refund policy?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"We are working hard in the background to line up as much as possible for the con. Therefore, once a ticket is sold, we consider it sold. Because we don't ask for names at the door, you're free to resell the ticket.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Are talks streamed or recorded?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"There are currently no plans for this.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend? Can I pay at the door?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"<span className='flex-override'>Yes!  If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc.</span>\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Does the payment name need to match the attendee name?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Appropriating the long tradition of other hacking conferences, Kernelcon does not require a 'registration name.'  However, with the desire many folks have to pre-register (e.g. to reserve a workshop space, ensure they have a ticket prior to selling out, etc) we do facilitate pre-sales which limits attendee anonymity in some ways.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"What do I need to bring with me to the registration desk?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"If you pre-registered online, you need to bring the barcode you received at the end of the pre-registration process.  If you intend to register at the door you need to bring payment.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Do you offer a group discount?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"<span className='flex-override'>We do!  Please contact <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a> for group orders of 10 or more!</span>\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Do you offer CPEs?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Kernelcon topics satisfy CPE requirements for several certifications, you may self-report and we will support if necessary.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Does Kernelcon have a dress code?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No.  If you really need guidance, many attendees will likely wear jeans, shirts (t-shirt, sweatshirt, polo shirt, etc), and comfortable shoes. You do you hackers.\\\"}];\",\"module.exports = [{\\\"heading\\\":\\\"Organizing Committee\\\",\\\"people\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Wacey Lanier\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Speaker

Although you may be familiar with a specific offensive or defensive use case for OSINT, you may not consider the opposite use case. Additionally, there is an entire world of investigations outside of Information Security, of which many are not aware. This course leverages both offensive and defensive applications of OSINT, in addition to pure investigative techniques, to equip students with an analytic toolkit for investigating businesses. The goal is to apply the “red yarn” to connect the proverbial red dots of seemingly unrelated and disparate abstract data in any OSINT investigation.</p><p>This course will start you at ground zero and equip you with an understanding of the bigger picture of intelligence operations. This is to get you into the mindset of an investigator to be more meticulous and patient in your collection and analysis. From here, we will springboard into applied search engines for OSINT to help you find the data you seek to find, which is often the case of not in what you “ask” the search engine, but how you ask it.</p><p>After search engines, you will be immersed in Open Source Image Intelligence (IMINT) and you work through learning about the types of image metadata, reverse image searching, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). You will conclude this module with a discussion of online video extraction for analysis in terms of tools and techniques to extract the video in addition to how you may find value in analyzing the video.</p><p>On day 2, you will learn about investigating businesses through their DNS records, social media, and public filings. You may already be familiar with some of the concepts in this module, but this module will help you develop analytic processes to more efficiently connect the proverbial dots.

The idea for Kernelcon started within the local DEF CON Group, <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"http://dc402.org\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DC402</a>, with lots of help from other members of other local security groups such as <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nebraskacert.org/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">NebraskaCERT</a> and <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Omaha\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">OWASP</a>.  We are inspired by many other conferences including DEF CON, DerbyCon, ShmooCon, etc., and wanted to bring those same experiences to the Mid-West here in Omaha.</p>\\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Our goal is to make Omaha an annual destination for security professionals around the world that want to have a unique conference experience.</p>\\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>We hope you enjoy the conference as much as we did planning it.</p>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"code-of-conduct\\\">\\n            <div className='tab-title'>Code Of Conduct</div>\\n            <div className='code-of-conduct-text'>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Kernelcon provides a forum for open discussion between participants, where radical viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We want Kernelcon to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. It's not about what you look like but what's in your mind and how you present yourself that counts at Kernelcon.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without refund and referral to the relevant authorities.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Kernelcon - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Kernelcon Crew.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Kernelcon Crew member, go to the registration desk, or info booth.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel security, local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of Kernelcon.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Remember: The CON is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for everyone.</p>\\n            </div>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"reciprocity\\\">\\n            <div className='reciprocity'>\\n              <div className='wording'>\\n                <div className='tab-title'>Stronger Together</div>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Some hacker conferences (or \\\"cons\\\") have developed a tradition of awarding a coveted, relatively rare, token to deserving folks.  Typically, the primary recipient of these tokens are the champions of the most difficult competitions conducted at the con.  For instance, the primary CTF contest is often a \\\"Black Badge event.\\\"</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>In addition to the accolades, the awarding of these tokens often carry other benefits.  Perhaps the most common is free entry to the conference for life.  </p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Not all conferences are the same, and many bestow other perks with the token.  Some cons take the right to anonymity very seriously, while others require attributed registration for their conference.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>One common characteristic to most hacker (and security, infosec, etc) cons, is the underpinning natural curiosity found in attendees, but keenly present in those that elect to spend their conference time competing in events.  Often these events are \\\"winner-takes-all\\\" with little or no perks for places other than first.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Another very common characteristic is the sense of community.  Each con develops its own sense of community, but there is also a sense of togetherness that spans cons, not owned or governed by any one con, but embodied by all.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Merging these components is long past due.  Starting today, with the end of DerbyCon, several peers in the community will begin honoring not only DerbyCon's black badge holders with free registration at their own conferences, but also each others.  Our hope is that this black badge reciprocity brings us even closer together as a community while also strengthening the ingrained traditions of curiosity and competition.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>The specifics of how each conference will handle things like registration complexities are actively being worked out, but many have confidence that the problem is tractable.  Accordingly, several are already pledging broad support, and each venue will ultimately be individually communicating details pertinent to registration.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#strongertogether</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#hackercommunity</p>\\n              </div>\\n              <div className='logo-space'>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/_kernelcon_'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={Kernelcon}\\n                    alt='kernelcon-logo'\\n                    className='con-logo-flip' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/grrcon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={GrrCon}\\n                    alt='grrcon-logo' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/DerbyCon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={DerbyCon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\\n                    alt='derbycon-logo' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/thotcon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={ThotCon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\\n                    alt='thotcon-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/cyphercon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={Cyphercon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip-flip'\\n                    alt='cyphercon-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/wwhackinfest'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={wwhackinfest} \\n                    alt='wwhf-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/texas_cyber'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={texas_cyber} \\n                    alt='texas_cyber-logo'/>\\t\\t\\t\\n                </a>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"organizers\\\">\\n            <Organizers />\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"contact\\\">\\n            <div className='text-area'>\\n              <div className='tab-title'>Stay in Touch</div>\\n              <div className='tab-paragraph'>We've got the social!

Many beers were had and slides discussed before culminating in a mission to gather knowledge seekers in the Midwest to propagate their techniques and mastery. Enter Kernelcon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">In 2019, we exceeded our targets with two speaking tracks, several conference events, and competitions for more than 350 attendees.  In 2020 we were one of the first security conferences to pivot to a pure-virtual format, populating two speaker live-streams, offering pre-conference training, and innovative virtual activities for our more than 400 paid attendees.  With the time to consider and plan for 2021 in a virtual context, we pioneered Hack Live, an online event that saw experts in various hacking disciplines hack challenges in their domain live.  Kernelcon partnered with the Ultimate Hacking Championship and brought Hack Live to thousands of world-wide viewers.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">For 2022, we are excited to return as an in-person event!  We are starting the festivities with two full days of training.  In the days immediately following training, we welcome both seasoned professionals and novice beginners to network, share their wisdom, and learn from one another during two days of affordable Cornhusker camaraderie. Laughs will be had and popcorn eaten at this intimate and enriching event. Our organizers are driven to provide both a new generation with the experiences that inspired us to love Infosec and bolster our community with a strong network of professionals. We are made stronger together.</p>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Suggested topic areas</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">The theme for Kernelcon 2022, is “Punk.”  Accordingly, those that wish to tailor a talk to the theme or require a broad topic to start the creative engine toward a new talk, Punk is your starting point.  Consider Punk Rock, Pop Punk, Cipherpunk, Cyberpunk, SteamPunk….but do not let these directions limit your interpretation!</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Kernelcon submissions should focus on topics that are of interest to the security and hacking communities. The list below is meant as a guideline, not an exhaustive list.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">\\n          <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list\\\">\\n            <li>Hacking of Software/Hardware</li>\\n            <li>Incident Response</li>\\n            <li>Operational Security</li>\\n            <li>Computing Hardware Security, Repurposing, Designing/Building</li>\\n            <li>Technology Policy and Politics (yep, we're willing to go there)</li>\\n            <li>Security Education</li>\\n            <li>Security and Hacking Capture-the-Flag Topics</li>\\n            <li>Security Automation</li>\\n            <li>Digital Forensics</li>\\n            <li>Bug Bounties</li>\\n            <li>Secure Development Practices / DevSecOps / SecDevOps</li>\\n            <li>Security Aspects of Cloud Computing</li>\\n            <li>Practical Security</li>\\n            <li>Machine Learning (securing, and using for security)</li>\\n            <li>War Stories, Histories, Scientific Advancement, Trade, etc. of Kernels</li>\\n            <li>Security Metrics (Inform Risk Analysis, Identify Priorities, Measure Progress, etc)</li>\\n            <li>Risk Management</li>\\n            <li>BeyondCorp / Zerotrust models in practice</li>\\n            <li>Privacy and Anonymity</li>\\n            <li>Identity & Access Management</li>\\n            <li>Focused Security Research (Visualization, IoT, Vehicles, Toys, Web apps, etc)</li>\\n          </ul>\\n          </p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">If your talk doesn't fit precisely into one of these areas, the theme, but you still think is a good fit, please submit it for consideration! The suggested topics are meant only to provide some direction, not as a strict pedantic gate through which all submissions must pass.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Conference format</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Kernelcon 2022 will have two, concurrent main tracks, and talks should fit into a 60 (FULL) or 20 (SHORT) minute timeslot (meaning a 50 or 15 minute presentation is expected). As one might expect, presenters will be positioned at the front of a hotel conference area, and will present using typical conference equipment.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Speaker Benefits</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Speakers receive complimentary admission to Kernelcon and will be recognized as a speaker via a special “SPEAKER” badge. Speakers also have the option of attending an exclusive speaker party preceding the conference. Details will be sent to accepted speakers following acceptance notification.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">For each FULL talk, the speakers may additionally select one of:</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">\\n            <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list\\\">\\n              <li>2 additional “HACKER” registrations</li>\\n              <li>$200 donation to the EFF or Hackers for Charity</li>\\n              <li>$200 honorarium</li>\\n              <li>Please reinvest into making Kernelcon even better next year</li>\\n            </ul>\\n          </p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">We may also tentatively accept backup/alternate talks which will not be guaranteed a speaking slot, but will receive admission in order to be ready to present in the event they are needed.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Review process</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Our review process is not as formal as some academic conferences. However, submissions are considered confidential and are not shared outside of the Technical Program Committee. Every submission is reviewed by multiple committee members and weighed for inclusion in the program. TPC Committee members are selected for the ability to provide valuable reviews, handle sensitive information, and remain fair, impartial, and consistent in the review process. Ultimately the committee informs the TPC Chair(s) who set the technical portion of the program that is married with the rest of Kernelcon agenda.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">How to submit</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Speakers should submit directly (e.g. no PR representatives are permitted).</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Please print the{\\\" \\\"}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thref=\\\"https://kernelcon.org/cfp/CFP-2022.pdf\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclassName=\\\"text-highlight\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttarget=\\\"_blank\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpdf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a>{\\\"\\\"} for your convenience!</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Your submission email should include:\\n            <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\\\">\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker name(s)</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Contact information (email, twitter, phone, etc - if we need to reach you and we can't, that's on you) *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker promotion information (twitter, facebook, etc) - if we want to promote your talk specifically, and you want us to tag you</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Presentation Title *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Abstract *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>A note if you'd like your submission to be presented to the program committee anonymously for review</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>The speaker \\\"Grant of Copyright Use\\\" and \\\"Speaker Terms\\\" copied and completed from below</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional supplementary files</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional scheduling preferences</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional opt-out of video recording</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Headshot if you have one you'd like to share (to be honest, we aren't sure if we'll use these, but if we need one, and you don't provide it, you will be depicted as a kernel of grain, nut, fruit, or corn)</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>At least one attached file in TEXT or PDF format which contains the following information in this order:\\n                <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\\\">\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Title of Presentation **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker Name(s), Pseudonym(s), or handle(s) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Timeslot (20 or 60 minutes)</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Abstract of your presentation (200 words or less) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Bio limited to 100 words or less (less than 100 words encompassing all speakers) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Technical Level of talk: on a 1-none to 5-all the way down the rabbit hole **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Detailed Description: <span className=\\\"text-highlight\\\">the most important part</span> of your submission.

Blatant vendor pitches, recycled talks, presentations on well-known topics that are *not* depicted as 101 or intro, are unlikely to be accepted. We expect presentations that are considerate, planned, thought-out, and delivered well. All talks are considered on their merits.

The ELK Stack is intended as a log analysis tool capable of ingesting structured data from unknown sources and deriving fields from the structured data for system monitoring, system health, visualizations, and other functions. ELK is routinely used to ingest, index, and display (and natively recognizes) data from common IT utilities such as web servers, security audit logs, etc. For example, security operations teams regularly use the ELK stack to centralize monitoring and perform hunt operations on networks they defend. Here, we demonstrate how to leverage the ELK stack\\u2019s capabilities to ingest data that has nothing to do with common IT utilities \\u2013 in particular, raw aircraft communications data captured via SDR. Using a system of relatively low-cost components, open-source software, and cloud computing, we will demonstrate how we captured raw ACARS data across multiple locations, structured it for transport, and pushed it through an ingestion pipeline for analysis and display on our own AWS-hosted infrastructure for the purpose of trend analysis, reverse engineering, and keyword search.\",talkTechLevel:\"3\",talkId:\"acars\",postCon:{pdfLink:\"\",videoLink:\"\"},authors:[{name:\"Carl Schuett\",speakerId:\"CarlSchuett\",company:\"\",twitter:\"\",github:\"\",linkedIn:\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-schuett-1a5a0b80/\",image:\"\",bio:\"Jesse and Carl are Security Researchers for QED Secure Solutions.

But cyber criminals are targeting more attacks on the software supply chain, exploiting software vulnerabilities that occur in production. As a result, organizations must prioritize protecting the open-source code in their applications. Attend this session to learn about the findings from the telemetry of thousands of real-world applications revealing trends of library usage, vulnerabilities, and best practices. You will learn about surprising findings such as: * Less than 10% of code in the typical application is open-source code actually used by the software. * Legacy software composition analysis (SCA) tools have a false positive rate of up to 69%. * The average library uses a version that is 2.5 years old, increasing risk and promising future headaches. * High-risk licenses are present in 69% of Java applications and 33% of Node applications. In a world of accelerating development and frequent exploitation of vulnerabilities, protecting applications containing open-source libraries and frameworks requires a different approach. Organizations need a comprehensive picture of active and inactive libraries and classes, library age, vulnerabilities, and licensing issues.

WSL is a supplemental feature that runs a Linux image in a near-native environment on Windows, allowing for terminal functionality without the over-head of a virtual machine. While this new functionality was welcomed by developers, it also introduced a new attack surface threat actors can ( and do ) target. Black Lotus Labs recently identified several malicious files that were compiled in the Linux binary format ELF which utilized native windows APIs. Over the past several months, Black Lotus Labs has identified numerous \"stagers\" - i.e. lightweight scripts that load more robust agents into memory - keyloggers, and in some cases fully functional remote access trojans. The novelty of using an ELF loader designed for the WSL environment gave the technique a detection rate nearly, or in some cases a, zero for sample found on Virustotal. Suggesting that while this technique may be niche, as it requires WSL to be pre-installed by an admin, it can provide threat actors a blind spot to operate while evading some EDR products. This talk will briefly introduce WSL, then focus on the samples Black Lotus Labs observed abusing this feature in the wild, and how we analyzed these malicious files.',talkTechLevel:\"2\",talkId:\"abusingwsl\",postCon:{pdfLink:\"\",videoLink:\"\"},authors:[{name:\"Daniel Adamitis\",speakerId:\"DanielAdamitis\",company:\"\",twitter:\"@dadamiti\",github:\"\",linkedIn:\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-a-44198047/\",image:\"Adamitis_headshot.jpg\",bio:\"Daniel Adamitis is a Principal Information Security Engineer at Lumen Technologies responsible for advanced actor tracking and threat intelligence.

Today acquisitions are on the rise, as leaders are looking for growth after the pandemic slowdown, and as new business models emerge based on the shift in consumer demands and mindset. This restructuring of organizations while buying or merging with another company can be cost-effective as they can reduce the costs of developing business activities that will complement a company's strengths. It can be a good investment to achieve its strategic long term goals for an organization while increasing the supply-chain pricing power and also eliminating the possible business competitors. While these moves often help a company remain competitive, if it is not done right it can make or break an organization.Weakened cybersecurity hygiene throughout the last year means that these M&A transactions elevate the risk of cybersecurity incidents. M&A can be a breeding battle ground for cyberattacks and data breaches. With the passage of the GDPR and the CCPA, and with more data privacy laws in the works, cybersecurity, and data privacy have become crucial elements of pre-M&A due diligence. Thorough due diligence that includes a focus on cybersecurity will help reduce regrets later in the deal lifecycle. Today's M&A plans need to include cybersecurity at several strategic and tactical points, to address growing scrutiny from regulators and other evolving cybersecurity risks.

Kernelcon is not just for hackers and IT professionals, it is for anyone who has an interest in computer security, hacking, malware research, or electronics.  If those or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy Kernelcon.\"},{question:\"Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?\",answer:\"Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we\\u2019re sure people are listening.\"},{question:\"Is there an age limit for attending Kernelcon?\",answer:\"No, while there is not content scheduled that is specifically focused on younger hackers, children are allowed. If they are under 14 years old, they receive free admission with a paid adult purchase.  All minors must be accompanied by a parent.\"},{question:\"What is the refund policy?\",answer:\"We are working hard in the background to line up as much as possible for the con. Therefore, once a ticket is sold, we consider it sold. Because we don't ask for names at the door, you're free to resell the ticket.\"},{question:\"I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?\",answer:\"No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string.\"},{question:\"Are talks streamed or recorded?\",answer:\"There are currently no plans for this.\"},{question:\"I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend? Can I pay at the door?\",answer:\"<span className='flex-override'>Yes!  If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc.</span>\"},{question:\"Does the payment name need to match the attendee name?\",answer:\"Appropriating the long tradition of other hacking conferences, Kernelcon does not require a 'registration name.'  However, with the desire many folks have to pre-register (e.g. to reserve a workshop space, ensure they have a ticket prior to selling out, etc) we do facilitate pre-sales which limits attendee anonymity in some ways.\"},{question:\"What do I need to bring with me to the registration desk?\",answer:\"If you pre-registered online, you need to bring the barcode you received at the end of the pre-registration process.  If you intend to register at the door you need to bring payment.\"},{question:\"Do you offer a group discount?\",answer:\"<span className='flex-override'>We do!  Please contact <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a> for group orders of 10 or more!</span>\"},{question:\"Do you offer CPEs?\",answer:\"Kernelcon topics satisfy CPE requirements for several certifications, you may self-report and we will support if necessary.\"},{question:\"Does Kernelcon have a dress code?\",answer:\"No.  If you really need guidance, many attendees will likely wear jeans, shirts (t-shirt, sweatshirt, polo shirt, etc), and comfortable shoes.

This is to get you into the mindset of an investigator to be more meticulous and patient in your collection and analysis.
