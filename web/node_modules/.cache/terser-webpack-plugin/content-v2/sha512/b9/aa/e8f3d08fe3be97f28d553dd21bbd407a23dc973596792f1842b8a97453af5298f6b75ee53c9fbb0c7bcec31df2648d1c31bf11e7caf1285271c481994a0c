Kernelcon is not just for hackers and IT professionals, it is for anyone who has an interest in computer security, hacking, malware research, or electronics.  If those or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy Kernelcon.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we’re sure people are listening.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Is there an age limit for attending Kernelcon?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"No, while there is not content scheduled that is specifically focused on younger hackers, children are allowed. If they are under 14 years old, they receive free admission with a paid adult purchase.  All minors must be accompanied by a parent.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What is the refund policy?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"We are working hard in the background to line up as much as possible for the con. Therefore, once a ticket is sold, we consider it sold. Because we don't ask for names at the door, you're free to resell the ticket.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Are talks streamed or recorded?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"There are currently no plans for this.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend? Can I pay at the door?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<span className='flex-override'>Yes!  If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc.</span>\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Does the payment name need to match the attendee name?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Appropriating the long tradition of other hacking conferences, Kernelcon does not require a 'registration name.'  However, with the desire many folks have to pre-register (e.g. to reserve a workshop space, ensure they have a ticket prior to selling out, etc) we do facilitate pre-sales which limits attendee anonymity in some ways.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"What do I need to bring with me to the registration desk?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"If you pre-registered online, you need to bring the barcode you received at the end of the pre-registration process.  If you intend to register at the door you need to bring payment.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Do you offer a group discount?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<span className='flex-override'>We do!  Please contact <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a> for group orders of 10 or more!</span>\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Do you offer CPEs?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Kernelcon topics satisfy CPE requirements for several certifications, you may self-report and we will support if necessary.\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\"question\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Does Kernelcon have a dress code?\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"answer\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"No.  If you really need guidance, many attendees will likely wear jeans, shirts (t-shirt, sweatshirt, polo shirt, etc), and comfortable shoes. You do you hackers.\\\\\\\"}]\\\"\",\"external \\\"[{\\\\\\\"heading\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Organizing Committee\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"people\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":1,\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Wacey

Rapidly process Linux logs and build a clearer picture of what happened on the system.</p>\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\"prerequisites\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<p>This course is an introduction to Linux forensics, but not an introduction to forensics. The course assumes at least some knowledge of digital forensic methods, such as evidence acquisition. This course is heavily command-line driven, so basic familiarity with the Linux command-line is helpful.</p>\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"equipment\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"<ul><li>A computer with at least 150GB of free

Kernelcon?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Yes you should.  Kernelcon is not just for hackers and IT professionals, it is for anyone who has an interest in computer security, hacking, malware research, or electronics.  If those or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy Kernelcon.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we’re sure people are listening.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Is there an age limit for attending Kernelcon?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No, while there is not content scheduled that is specifically focused on younger hackers, children are allowed. If they are under 14 years old, they receive free admission with a paid adult purchase.  All minors must be accompanied by a parent.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"What is the refund policy?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"We are working hard in the background to line up as much as possible for the con. Therefore, once a ticket is sold, we consider it sold. Because we don't ask for names at the door, you're free to resell the ticket.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Are talks streamed or recorded?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"There are currently no plans for this.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend? Can I pay at the door?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"<span className='flex-override'>Yes!  If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc.</span>\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Does the payment name need to match the attendee name?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Appropriating the long tradition of other hacking conferences, Kernelcon does not require a 'registration name.'  However, with the desire many folks have to pre-register (e.g. to reserve a workshop space, ensure they have a ticket prior to selling out, etc) we do facilitate pre-sales which limits attendee anonymity in some ways.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"What do I need to bring with me to the registration desk?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"If you pre-registered online, you need to bring the barcode you received at the end of the pre-registration process.  If you intend to register at the door you need to bring payment.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Do you offer a group discount?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"<span className='flex-override'>We do!  Please contact <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a> for group orders of 10 or more!</span>\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Do you offer CPEs?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"Kernelcon topics satisfy CPE requirements for several certifications, you may self-report and we will support if necessary.\\\"},{\\\"question\\\":\\\"Does Kernelcon have a dress code?\\\",\\\"answer\\\":\\\"No.  If you really need guidance, many attendees will likely wear jeans, shirts (t-shirt, sweatshirt, polo shirt, etc), and comfortable shoes. You do you hackers.\\\"}];\",\"module.exports = [{\\\"heading\\\":\\\"Organizing Committee\\\",\\\"people\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Wacey Lanier\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Speaker

className='tab-title'>About Kernelcon</div>\\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Kernelcon is the result of many motivated information security professionals who recognized the opportunity to create an awesome security conference in Omaha.  The idea for Kernelcon started within the local DEF CON Group, <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"http://dc402.org\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">DC402</a>, with lots of help from other members of other local security groups such as <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"https://www.nebraskacert.org/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">NebraskaCERT</a> and <a className=\\\"text-highlight\\\" href=\\\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Omaha\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">OWASP</a>.  We are inspired by many other conferences including DEF CON, DerbyCon, ShmooCon, etc., and wanted to bring those same experiences to the Mid-West here in Omaha.</p>\\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Our goal is to make Omaha an annual destination for security professionals around the world that want to have a unique conference experience.</p>\\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>We hope you enjoy the conference as much as we did planning it.</p>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"code-of-conduct\\\">\\n            <div className='tab-title'>Code Of Conduct</div>\\n            <div className='code-of-conduct-text'>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Kernelcon provides a forum for open discussion between participants, where radical viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We want Kernelcon to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. It's not about what you look like but what's in your mind and how you present yourself that counts at Kernelcon.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without refund and referral to the relevant authorities.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Kernelcon - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Kernelcon Crew.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Kernelcon Crew member, go to the registration desk, or info booth.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel security, local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of Kernelcon.</p>\\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Remember: The CON is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for everyone.</p>\\n            </div>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"reciprocity\\\">\\n            <div className='reciprocity'>\\n              <div className='wording'>\\n                <div className='tab-title'>Stronger Together</div>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Some hacker conferences (or \\\"cons\\\") have developed a tradition of awarding a coveted, relatively rare, token to deserving folks.  Typically, the primary recipient of these tokens are the champions of the most difficult competitions conducted at the con.  For instance, the primary CTF contest is often a \\\"Black Badge event.\\\"</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>In addition to the accolades, the awarding of these tokens often carry other benefits.  Perhaps the most common is free entry to the conference for life.  </p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Not all conferences are the same, and many bestow other perks with the token.  Some cons take the right to anonymity very seriously, while others require attributed registration for their conference.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>One common characteristic to most hacker (and security, infosec, etc) cons, is the underpinning natural curiosity found in attendees, but keenly present in those that elect to spend their conference time competing in events.  Often these events are \\\"winner-takes-all\\\" with little or no perks for places other than first.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Another very common characteristic is the sense of community.  Each con develops its own sense of community, but there is also a sense of togetherness that spans cons, not owned or governed by any one con, but embodied by all.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Merging these components is long past due.  Starting today, with the end of DerbyCon, several peers in the community will begin honoring not only DerbyCon's black badge holders with free registration at their own conferences, but also each others.  Our hope is that this black badge reciprocity brings us even closer together as a community while also strengthening the ingrained traditions of curiosity and competition.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>The specifics of how each conference will handle things like registration complexities are actively being worked out, but many have confidence that the problem is tractable.  Accordingly, several are already pledging broad support, and each venue will ultimately be individually communicating details pertinent to registration.</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#strongertogether</p>\\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#hackercommunity</p>\\n              </div>\\n              <div className='logo-space'>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/_kernelcon_'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={Kernelcon}\\n                    alt='kernelcon-logo'\\n                    className='con-logo-flip' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/grrcon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={GrrCon}\\n                    alt='grrcon-logo' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/DerbyCon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={DerbyCon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\\n                    alt='derbycon-logo' />\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/thotcon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={ThotCon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\\n                    alt='thotcon-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/cyphercon'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={Cyphercon}\\n                  className='con-logo-flip-flip'\\n                    alt='cyphercon-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/wwhackinfest'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={wwhackinfest} \\n                    alt='wwhf-logo'/>\\n                </a>\\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/texas_cyber'\\n                  target='_blank'\\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\\n                  <img src={texas_cyber} \\n                    alt='texas_cyber-logo'/>\\t\\t\\t\\n                </a>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"organizers\\\">\\n            <Organizers />\\n          </TabPanel>\\n          <TabPanel tabId=\\\"contact\\\">\\n            <div className='text-area'>\\n              <div className='tab-title'>Stay in Touch</div>\\n              <div className='tab-paragraph'>We've got the social!

Many beers were had and slides discussed before culminating in a mission to gather knowledge seekers in the Midwest to propagate their techniques and mastery. Enter Kernelcon.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">In 2019, we exceeded our targets with two speaking tracks, several conference events, and competitions for more than 350 attendees.  In 2020 we were one of the first security conferences to pivot to a pure-virtual format, populating two speaker live-streams, offering pre-conference training, and innovative virtual activities for our more than 400 paid attendees.  With the time to consider and plan for 2021 in a virtual context, we pioneered Hack Live, an online event that saw experts in various hacking disciplines hack challenges in their domain live.  Kernelcon partnered with the Ultimate Hacking Championship and brought Hack Live to thousands of world-wide viewers.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">For 2022, we are excited to return as an in-person event!  We are starting the festivities with two full days of training.  In the days immediately following training, we welcome both seasoned professionals and novice beginners to network, share their wisdom, and learn from one another during two days of affordable Cornhusker camaraderie. Laughs will be had and popcorn eaten at this intimate and enriching event. Our organizers are driven to provide both a new generation with the experiences that inspired us to love Infosec and bolster our community with a strong network of professionals. We are made stronger together.</p>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Suggested topic areas</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">The theme for Kernelcon 2022, is “Punk.”  Accordingly, those that wish to tailor a talk to the theme or require a broad topic to start the creative engine toward a new talk, Punk is your starting point.  Consider Punk Rock, Pop Punk, Cipherpunk, Cyberpunk, SteamPunk….but do not let these directions limit your interpretation!</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Kernelcon submissions should focus on topics that are of interest to the security and hacking communities. The list below is meant as a guideline, not an exhaustive list.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">\\n          <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list\\\">\\n            <li>Hacking of Software/Hardware</li>\\n            <li>Incident Response</li>\\n            <li>Operational Security</li>\\n            <li>Computing Hardware Security, Repurposing, Designing/Building</li>\\n            <li>Technology Policy and Politics (yep, we're willing to go there)</li>\\n            <li>Security Education</li>\\n            <li>Security and Hacking Capture-the-Flag Topics</li>\\n            <li>Security Automation</li>\\n            <li>Digital Forensics</li>\\n            <li>Bug Bounties</li>\\n            <li>Secure Development Practices / DevSecOps / SecDevOps</li>\\n            <li>Security Aspects of Cloud Computing</li>\\n            <li>Practical Security</li>\\n            <li>Machine Learning (securing, and using for security)</li>\\n            <li>War Stories, Histories, Scientific Advancement, Trade, etc. of Kernels</li>\\n            <li>Security Metrics (Inform Risk Analysis, Identify Priorities, Measure Progress, etc)</li>\\n            <li>Risk Management</li>\\n            <li>BeyondCorp / Zerotrust models in practice</li>\\n            <li>Privacy and Anonymity</li>\\n            <li>Identity & Access Management</li>\\n            <li>Focused Security Research (Visualization, IoT, Vehicles, Toys, Web apps, etc)</li>\\n          </ul>\\n          </p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">If your talk doesn't fit precisely into one of these areas, the theme, but you still think is a good fit, please submit it for consideration! The suggested topics are meant only to provide some direction, not as a strict pedantic gate through which all submissions must pass.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Conference format</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Kernelcon 2022 will have two, concurrent main tracks, and talks should fit into a 60 (FULL) or 20 (SHORT) minute timeslot (meaning a 50 or 15 minute presentation is expected). As one might expect, presenters will be positioned at the front of a hotel conference area, and will present using typical conference equipment.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Speaker Benefits</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Speakers receive complimentary admission to Kernelcon and will be recognized as a speaker via a special “SPEAKER” badge. Speakers also have the option of attending an exclusive speaker party preceding the conference. Details will be sent to accepted speakers following acceptance notification.</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">For each FULL talk, the speakers may additionally select one of:</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">\\n            <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list\\\">\\n              <li>2 additional “HACKER” registrations</li>\\n              <li>$200 donation to the EFF or Hackers for Charity</li>\\n              <li>$200 honorarium</li>\\n              <li>Please reinvest into making Kernelcon even better next year</li>\\n            </ul>\\n          </p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">We may also tentatively accept backup/alternate talks which will not be guaranteed a speaking slot, but will receive admission in order to be ready to present in the event they are needed.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">Review process</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Our review process is not as formal as some academic conferences. However, submissions are considered confidential and are not shared outside of the Technical Program Committee. Every submission is reviewed by multiple committee members and weighed for inclusion in the program. TPC Committee members are selected for the ability to provide valuable reviews, handle sensitive information, and remain fair, impartial, and consistent in the review process. Ultimately the committee informs the TPC Chair(s) who set the technical portion of the program that is married with the rest of Kernelcon agenda.</p>\\n\\n          <div className=\\\"tab-title\\\">How to submit</div>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Speakers should submit directly (e.g. no PR representatives are permitted).</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Please print the{\\\" \\\"}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thref=\\\"https://kernelcon.org/cfp/CFP-2022.pdf\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclassName=\\\"text-highlight\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\trel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttarget=\\\"_blank\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpdf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</a>{\\\"\\\"} for your convenience!</p>\\n          <p className=\\\"tab-paragraph\\\">Your submission email should include:\\n            <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\\\">\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker name(s)</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Contact information (email, twitter, phone, etc - if we need to reach you and we can't, that's on you) *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker promotion information (twitter, facebook, etc) - if we want to promote your talk specifically, and you want us to tag you</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Presentation Title *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Abstract *</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>A note if you'd like your submission to be presented to the program committee anonymously for review</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>The speaker \\\"Grant of Copyright Use\\\" and \\\"Speaker Terms\\\" copied and completed from below</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional supplementary files</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional scheduling preferences</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Optional opt-out of video recording</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Headshot if you have one you'd like to share (to be honest, we aren't sure if we'll use these, but if we need one, and you don't provide it, you will be depicted as a kernel of grain, nut, fruit, or corn)</li>\\n              <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>At least one attached file in TEXT or PDF format which contains the following information in this order:\\n                <ul className=\\\"real-bullet-list no-bullets\\\">\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Title of Presentation **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Speaker Name(s), Pseudonym(s), or handle(s) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Timeslot (20 or 60 minutes)</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Abstract of your presentation (200 words or less) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Bio limited to 100 words or less (less than 100 words encompassing all speakers) **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Technical Level of talk: on a 1-none to 5-all the way down the rabbit hole **</li>\\n                  <li><input className=\\\"fake-checkbox\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\"/>Detailed Description: <span className=\\\"text-highlight\\\">the most important part</span> of your submission.

Blatant vendor pitches, recycled talks, presentations on well-known topics that are *not* depicted as 101 or intro, are unlikely to be accepted. We expect presentations that are considerate, planned, thought-out, and delivered well. All talks are considered on their merits.

Kernelcon is not just for hackers and IT professionals, it is for anyone who has an interest in computer security, hacking, malware research, or electronics.  If those or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy Kernelcon.\"},{question:\"Is there an Internet Connection at Kernelcon?\",answer:\"Of course! How else are you going to be able to post pics of all the fun at Kernelcon to IG? We aim to provide a robust and highly capable wireless network. You should consider it semi-hostile. Make sure you use appropriate VPN or other secure methods of communication because it is a security conference after all, and we\\u2019re sure people are listening.\"},{question:\"Is there an age limit for attending Kernelcon?\",answer:\"No, while there is not content scheduled that is specifically focused on younger hackers, children are allowed. If they are under 14 years old, they receive free admission with a paid adult purchase.  All minors must be accompanied by a parent.\"},{question:\"What is the refund policy?\",answer:\"We are working hard in the background to line up as much as possible for the con. Therefore, once a ticket is sold, we consider it sold. Because we don't ask for names at the door, you're free to resell the ticket.\"},{question:\"I want to submit a talk, does it have to be about kernels?\",answer:\"No, but we smile when talks include core parts of a operating system, a softer typically edible part of a nut, cereal, grain, fruit, corn, a convolution matrix, classes of algorithms like SVM, or an unmarked linguistic string.\"},{question:\"Are talks streamed or recorded?\",answer:\"There are currently no plans for this.\"},{question:\"I can't or don't want to register online (technical issue, privacy issue, etc), can I still attend?

If you have an issue but still want to register early, please contact us at <a class='gold' href='mailto:info@kernelcon.org'>info@kernelcon.org</a>.  We will be accepting cash at the door.  Keep in mind that registering early guarantees you swag, that clothing is appropriate size, that workshops you want aren't full, etc.</span>\"},{question:\"Does the payment name need to match the attendee name?\",answer:\"Appropriating the long tradition of other hacking conferences, Kernelcon does not require a 'registration name.'  However, with the desire many folks have to pre-register (e.g. to reserve a workshop space, ensure they have a ticket prior to selling out, etc) we do facilitate pre-sales which limits attendee anonymity in some ways.\"},{question:\"What do I need to bring with me to the registration desk?\",answer:\"If you pre-registered online, you need to bring the barcode you received at the end of the pre-registration process.  If you intend to register at the door you need to bring payment.\"},{question:\"Do you offer a group discount?\",answer:\"<span className='flex-override'>We do!
